## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project focuses on deploying an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) detection system using real-time HL7 messages. The system is designed to run in a single Docker container and operates in a simulated hospital environment before real-world deployment.

The system processes historical and live blood test data, detects potential AKI cases based on creatinine levels, and triggers pager alerts for medical intervention. It integrates with an HL7 simulator via the MLLP protocol and acknowledges messages to maintain a reliable data stream

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

In order to test  the system, you can simply run:

```shell
python3 run_tests.py
```

This will trigger all the unit tests.
If you want to add a coverage report, then run:

```shell
python3 run_tests.py --coverage
```

Which will create an HTML coverage report in /coverage_html_report/index.html

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
